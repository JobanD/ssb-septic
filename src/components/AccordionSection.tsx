        <AccordionContent>
        If your home is in a rural location, a small community, or if you own a cottage, it's likely that your property utilizes a septic system or holding tank. 
        These systems serve as localized treatment facilities for areas where municipal sewer systems aren't available, handling everything that's washed down drainsâ€”from shower water to toilet flushes. 
        A septic system consists of a tank and a series of pipes, working with countless microorganisms to treat your waste.
